# Functional Web App

Functional Web Apps (FWA) are a different way to build dynamic full-stack web apps.


## Principles

<details>
  <summary>Pure functions</summary>
  <p>Functional Web Apps are a cloud function centered development model. No servers to scale or patch frees developers to focus on unique business logic as pure single-responsibility functions. Spanning the full-stack from front-end to back-end an entire application can be modelled as cloud functions â€“ each with singular purpose. Functions can be written in any programming language and a Functional Web App can even leverage different runtimes in the same app for their respective strengths. Single-responsibility functions are interchangable, replacable, easily added or removed, and test; they coldstart faster and offer more granularity for least-priviledge security.</p>

  <summary>Dynamic first</summary>
  <p>Functional Web Apps employ modern managed database that scales to meet demand, without manual sharding, while boasting consistent low-latency performance no matter how much data is being stored. Instead of forcing web consumers to wait for the HTML content they came for behind an obnoxious loading spinner everything is rendered immediately on-demand. </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Accessible by default</summary>
  <p>Functional Web Apps employ progressive enhancement for interactivity recognizing that HTML loads first and JavaScript isn't always available for a variety of reasons. This ensures web consumers get the fastest and most accessible experience by default. </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Declarative deployment</summary>
  <p>Functional Web Apps deploy quickly, consistently and reliably. Cloud infra is an explicitly defined dependency that lives in version control beside the code that depends on it.</p>

## Practices

- Cloud functions centered development model
- Modern low-latency autoscaling database
- Progressive enhancement for behavior
- Infra as Code for reliable deployment
