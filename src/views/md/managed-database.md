# Managed database

Dynamic web applications require a primary database. Databases are complicated to provision, costly to monitor, challenging to scale and update. The sole focus of a managed database provider is to keep your database stable and secure.

A managed database takes care of provisioning, monitoring, security patching, and running regular backups. Modern managed databases are transparently auto-scaling, so application code does not require special logic for sharding concerns. Database performance is always crucial, so most managed databases can meet any level of demand, no matter how much data is stored or how many clients are trying to access it, while retaining low-latency performance.

A managed database frees developers to create and maintain the business logic for reading and writing data, outsourcing the mundane and complicated database administration tasks to a specialist vendor.
