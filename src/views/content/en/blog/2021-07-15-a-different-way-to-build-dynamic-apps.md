## A different way to build dynamic web apps
Posted 2021-07-15 by Brian LeRoux

The Functional Web App (FWA) is a different way to build a dynamic web app. It combines traditional, proven practices with next-generation cloud infra to overcome the slow performance and complexity traditional app architectures while also creating a better web consumer experiences than can be offered by static pre-rendering.

FWAs are made possible by two technology advances: cloud functions, and next-generation managed databases. Cloud functions allow us to render HTML on-the-fly autoscaling to meet demand, and managed databases guarantee high performance no matter how much data we have.

FWAs are less work, while still encompassing the full-stack, empowering front-end web developers to focus on unique business logic instead of brittle, insecure and clunky build infrastructure. End users get an optimal personalized HTML-first experience without waiting for their content to load.
