# Managed database

Dynamic web applications require a primary database. Traditionally, databases are often the most complicated part of an application to manage, and are an ongoing challenge to scale and update throughout their service life.

The sole purpose of a managed database provider is to keep your database fast, stable, and secure. Functional Web Apps rely on a managed database to ensure customer data is always immediately available to each cloud function invocation, enabling them to deliver fully rendered web and API responses.

Using a managed database frees FWA developers to create and maintain the business logic for reading and writing data, outsourcing mundane and complicated database administration tasks to a specialist vendor.


### Maintability

Cloud functions are a pure unit of encapsulation for trusted compute, reducing an application's maintenance burden and total cost of ownership. In much the same way, managed databases help reduce the time and expertise necessary to meet a primary requirement of dynamic web applications: data persistence.

Functional Web Apps should be able to rely on their persistence layer to automatically scale up (and down) to meet demand in real-time, to never require scheduled maintenance for updates. Conversely, FWA developers should not be burdened by costly database monitoring systems or tools, or require any domain expertise for performance optimization.


### Scalability

A managed database provider is responsible of provisioning, monitoring, security patching, and running regular backups. Functional Web Apps expect managed databases to transparently auto-scale, meaning application code does not require special logic for sharding concerns.

Database performance is always crucial, so a FWA's primary managed database should meet any level of demand, no matter how much data is stored, or how many clients are trying to access it, while retaining low-latency performance.
